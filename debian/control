Description: Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch
 Scribus is an open source desktop page layout program with the aim of
 producing commercial grade output in PDF and Postscript, primarily, though
 not exclusively for Linux.
 .
 Scribus can be used for many tasks; from brochure design to newspapers,
 magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation. It has
 sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text
 and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons,
 precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The
 Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file
 formats, even damaged documents, can be recovered with a simple text editor.
 .
 Scribus supports professional DTP features, such as CMYK color and a
 color management system to soft proof images for high quality color printing,
 flexible PDF creation options, Encapsulated PostScript import/export and
 creation of 4 color separations, import of EPS/PS and SVG as native vector
 graphics, Unicode text including right to left scripts such as Arabic and
 Hebrew via freetype. Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus as images
 include PDF, Encapsulated Post Script (eps), TIFF, JPEG, PNG and XPixMap(xpm),
 and any bitmap type supported by QT4.
 .
 Printing, PDF and SVG creation are done via custom driver libraries and
 plug-ins, giving Scribus inventive features: the abilities to include
 presentation effects with PDF output, fully scriptable interactive PDF
 forms, SVG vector file output. The internal printer drivers fully support
 Level 2 and Level 3/PDF 1.4 postscript features including transparency and
 font embedding.
 .
 When run from KDE, Drag and Drop, for example from desktop to the canvas,
 is enabled. There is easy to use drag and drop scrapbook for frequently
 used items such as text blocks, pictures and custom shaped frames.
