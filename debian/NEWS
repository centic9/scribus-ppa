scribus (1.3.9.dfsg+svn20110210-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a Qt4 developmental branch converging to a stable 1.4.0 release.
    File format in 1.3.x is incompatible with the earlier releases based on
    Qt3 (1.3.3.x packages). There is no going back! Stay with Debian Stable if
    you need to use a 1.3.3.x package. Use this package when you are ready to
    transition to the 1.3.x series. However, be aware that after this upload
    there will no longer be a 1.3.3.x package in Debian, so it's a good time to
    start planning your transition.
